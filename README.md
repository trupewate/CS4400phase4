## CS4400 Phase 4 Team 23

### Instruction to set up and run the app
1) Ensure that python is installed on your device (3.7 was used when developing the app, but any version should work)<br>
2) install dependencies inside requirements.txt with the specified versions. <br>
3) Enter your password (and other details if different) in app.py (lines 19-23) configs to connect to mysql database <br>
4) run 'python app.py' in console and open localhost in browser

### Overview of technologies 
We used Flask framework for back-end and html/css/Bootstrap for frontent. We used 'flask-mysql' library to connect to mysql db 'drone_spatch' 
and utisized its functionality to interact with db at the backend. For the front-end we used Jinja2 syntax which comes with Flask installation to 
leverage dynamic updating of the pages.
